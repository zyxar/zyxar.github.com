## 1. Choosing the Right Equipment ##

### Cameras ###

- Film SLR is still a popular camera choice for a remote expedition.
    - old manual SLRs, as well as most rangefinders, possess a mechanical shutter system that can operate without any power source;
    - **downsides**: no instantly review; more experience needed; physical medium of film;
    - fSLR can be a great backup.

- DSLRs
    - pros: larger sensors, modular and interchangeable lenses, live view, longer battery life, faster, auto-bracketing;
    - cons: heavier and bulkier;
    - *HDR* capability.

- Compact Cameras   
    - **disadvantages**: heavy noise, low battery life, slow autofocus, shutter lag, non-interchangeable lenses; even no viewfinder; lack of 'RAW';
    - considerable *only* when: 
        1. the climb is very difficult: light weight is more important than bringing back good images;
        2. snapshots to complement your personal memories;
        3. a high-end compact could serve as a useful backup.

- EVILs (Electonic Viewfinder Interchangeable Lens Cameras)
    - designed for street photography; close to APS-C DSLRs (with consumer lenses);
    - cons: absence of an optical viewfinder;
    - trade-off between weight and some special features and more choices in lenses (against DSLR).

- The Big Stuff
    - a bad idea.

- **Summary**
    - DSLR or EVIL; compact as a backup.
    - it depends.

### Lenses ###

- balance versatility and features with weight and portability;
- no need to focus on large apertures;
- sometimes it is inconvenient to change lenses;
- a wide lens is generally the most useful; *default* choice;
- oftentimes, telephoto lenses are a necessity; 200mm should be enough; *secondary* choice;
- ultra wide lenses are tricky to use;
- prime lenses: for experienced;
- gather some statistics in photo archives.

### Carrying Systems ###

- **have your camera accessible at all times**;
- backpack with survival items;
- without fuss;
- size should be adapted;
- all the equipment you might use should be accessible;
- reasonably weather resistant;
- simple design: internal separators and a small pocket for memory cards and batteries;
- lightweight;
- *camera backpacks* are worst, *chest* bag and *shoulder* bag are not that good;
- a *belt system* is the best solution: a padded belt and a few detachable pouches.

### Battery and Memory Strategies ###

- at least enough cards to get you through one day of shooting;
- *cold is the deadliest threat to batteries*;
- careful and constant monitoring power sources;

### Odds and Ends ###

- lens caps, *UV filters*;
- *lens hoods*;
- *microfiber cloth*;
- need permission from every recognizable person in images;

### Dead Weight ###

- tripod: isn't very useful in the mountains -> find a platform stable enough;
- artifical lighting: flash is more trouble than help;
- filters: UV or clear filters only;
- laptop: no;

### Bring with ###

- For Hiking and Less Demanding Climbs, e.g.:
    - Nikon D90 w/ 2+ batteries, 12GB SD cards;
    - Nikkor 16-35mm f/4 VR, 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 VR (equipped w/ UV);
    - Think Tank Skin belt system;

- For Difficult Climbs, e.g.:
    - EP-1 Pen m43, w/ 12GB SD cards;
    - Zuiko 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6;

## 2. Shooting ##

### When to Shoot ###

- be psychologically prepared to stop in very inconvenient places; no fuss;
- checklist:
    - how safe is it to stop now?
    - how are your partners going to react?
    - how long is the photo opportunity likely to last?
    - how good is the image going to be?

### Caring for Your Gear ###

- weather protection, cold;
- water (humidity, rain), *condensation*;
- dust -> be extra careful;
- how **NOT** to drop stuff: 
    - connect the camera strap to harness or bag;
    - climbing sling;
- *Safety*: 
    - always pack anything fragile or expensive as carry-on luggage;
    - never leave bags out of your sight;
    - keep 'em attached;

### A Complete Workflow ###

- keep an eye out and an open mind for any potential photo;
- assess enviornment;
- communicate with partners;
- anchor yourself somewhere when needed;
- check the histogram;
- blahblahblah...

### Exposure ###

- snow: compensation to eliminate underexposing;
- ETTR (Expose To The Right): only against RAW, w/ post-processing;
- high contrast: use HDR, check histogram;

## 3. Creating Powerful Images ##

### Be Inspired ###

- have something to say, and express it through photography;

### Quantity vs. Quality ###

- give you mileage;
- occasionally stumble upon hidden gems;
- you are not obligated to produce a masterpiece each time;
- photo opportunities are both unique and short-lived;
- images are great memories;
+ heavy editing;
* shooting a lot replaces critical thinking and is only masking the photographer's laziness of finding the optimal viewpoint for a scene.

### Composition ###

Do *NOT* overestimate the checklist:

- rule of thirds;
- direct attention to a subject by color and light;
- strong shapes and lines;
- edges of an image are a sensitive area;
- out-of-focus background are important;
- leave plenty of space in image when subject is moving or looking in a direction;
- simpler composition -> stronger image.

*Through experience, by shooting thousands of images and seeing thousands more, both good and bad*.

### The Story ###

- put the image into words -> simply describe it;
- not to *explain* the story with extra info that does not show in the image.

### More Practicaly ###

- learn to see light and treat it as a subject in its own right;
- search for the optimal point of view;
- observer the weather, and make it another one of your subject;
- mountains are vertical environments;
- natural scenes look the same at any scale;
- get the timing just right when action shooting;
- pay attention to the backgrounds;
- place people in their enviroment unless for portraits;
- diversity of genres;
- break the rules, and experiment.

## 4. Discipline Specific ##

Four categories: camping, hiking, technical climbing, and mountaineering.

### Camping ###

- best light: sun is low;
- keep things simple, though getting good images of a campsite can be surprisingly difficult;
- opportunities: night, sunset;

### Hiking ###

hiking is the easiest of the three different outdoor disciplines

- hiking scenes can lack visual drama;
- figure out the path;
- build your image backwards -> from backgrounds to foregrounds;
- place other hikers out of focus;
- faces creat very powerful photographs;
- alone? stable platform + self-timer;

### Technical Climbing ###

- perspective is the most important element of composition;
- show the face (of the leader);
- pay attention to backgrounds;
- the last important element is action;
- offer to send unknown climbers your pictures.

### Mountaineering ###

- the composition advice from the previous sections all apply;
- make the effort to look for good photo opportunities;

## 5. Advanced Techniques ##

### Low Light and Night Photography ###

- full aperture -> but reduce depth of field;
- close the aperture until the depth of field is large enough to includes your subject;
- (unless shooting film) incress ISO;
- tripod -> tough: mirror lock-up, remote trigger, self-timer,etc;
- long exposure times will only work with relatively static subjects;
- metering and focus;
    - full manual mode;
    - test until acceptable exposure has been obtained;
- sometimes, use a flash/strobe;

### Panoramic Images ###

- a tripod and a panorama head;
- is panorama essential?
- select a focal length;
- post-process.
- manual exposure w/ tests, to avoid zebra looking in stitched final image;
- take all the pictures in as short a time as possible;
- repeat the entire process if necessary;

### HDR ###

- check histogram: whether it is cut off at **both** ends;
- otherwise, adjust the exposure compensation;
- auto-bracketing;

### Video ###

- careful planning;
- a closeup of a face;
- a mid-range shot;
- a closeup of hands;
- a point-of-view shot;
- get creative;
- composition rules from previous chapters;
- sound should never be underestimated;
- take it easy on the effects.

## 6. Closing Thoughts ##

### Ethics and Photo Manipulations ###

**The only question is who should do the manipulation, the user or the camera.**

- minor modifications and scene-changing modifications;
- be honest about your choices;
- photo manipulations are subjective;

### Safety and the Environment ###

- safety 1st;
- seek proper instr before venturing into wildnerness areas;
- [leave no trace philosophy](www.lnt.org)
